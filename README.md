# Rust Invaders!

This is a little sample project I built along my journey to learn Rust.  

I followed along with Nathan Stock's Udemy course titled the "Ultimate Rust Crash Course"

## Steps to Play

1) Install Rust
  I use `asdf` to manage my machine's Rust installation.

2) Build the project with `cargo build`

3) Run the game with `cargo run`

## Commands

```
Left Key - Move spaceship left
Right Key - Move spaceship right
Spacebar or Enter - Fire Weapons!
Esc or Q - Exit the game
```

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to Nathan Stocks for such a great course!
